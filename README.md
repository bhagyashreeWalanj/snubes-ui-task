# Snubes Code Challenge

> This is an implemenation of the code challenge given by Snubes as part of interview process. .

Currently developing an Snubes Responsive Web Page.

Key Features

1. Used the Zeplin Design system to develop end-to-end responsive designs.
2. The input box "Company name" should validate the name up to 80 characters max, and numbers are not allowed.
3. The input box "Name" should validate up to 50 characters; all characters are allowed.
4. The input box "Phone number" should validate only numbers, and please prefill the country ISD code according to the location. For example, if a person opens your application in Germany, then +49 should be prefilled in the number input box; or if the country is France, then it should be +33 and so on. (Hint: Please keep in mind if the browser location is turned off, then how you will achieve it)
